            <p>Let's explore how websites work!</p>

                <h2>🏠 What is a Website?</h2>
                <p>A website is a collection of web pages that are connected together and accessed through the internet. Think of it like a digital book where each page has information, images, videos, and links to other pages!</p>
                <p>The website you're looking at right now is made of <strong>HTML</strong>, which is the language that tells your browser how to display text, images, and buttons.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>📝 HTML - The Building Blocks</h2>
                <p><strong>HTML</strong> stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the code that creates the structure of every website you visit. HTML uses "tags" to tell the browser what each part of the page should be.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
                    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;<br>
                    &lt;a href="link.com"&gt;This is a link&lt;/a&gt;
                </div>
                <p>Every website you visit is built with HTML! Some websites also use CSS to make things look pretty and JavaScript to make things interactive.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <h2>🖥️ Servers - Where Websites Live</h2>
                <p>A <strong>server</strong> is a powerful computer that stores websites and sends them to your device when you request them. Think of it like a library that holds all the books (websites) and gives you the one you ask for!</p>
                <p>When you type a website address into your browser, your computer asks the server "Can I see this website please?" and the server sends all the files back to your computer so you can see the website.</p>
                <div class="fun-fact">
                    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some websites are stored on thousands of servers around the world so they can load super fast no matter where you are!

            <div class="section">
                <h2>🔗 HTTP - The Language of the Web</h2>
                <p><strong>HTTP</strong> stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It's like the language your computer uses to talk to servers! When you visit a website, your browser and the server use HTTP to communicate.</p>
                <p>You'll often see <strong>HTTPS</strong> in website addresses - the "S" stands for "Secure" which means the information is encrypted (scrambled) so nobody can spy on what you're doing. Always look for HTTPS when entering passwords or personal information!</p>
                <div class="example">
                    https://www.example.com
                </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>🔍 Inspect Element - Peek Behind the Curtain</h2>
                <p><strong>Inspect Element</strong> is a special tool built into web browsers that lets you see the HTML code of any website! It's like having X-ray vision for websites.</p>
                <p><strong>Try it right now!</strong> Right-click anywhere on this page and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element". You'll see all the HTML code that makes this page work! Don't worry - you can't break anything by looking at the code.</p>
                <div class="fun-fact">
                    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Web developers use Inspect Element every day to test and fix their websites. You can even change what the website looks like on YOUR screen (but it won't change for anyone else)!

                <h2>🌍 URLs - Website Addresses</h2>
                <p>A <strong>URL</strong> (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a website, like a home address but for the internet! Every website has its own unique URL.</p>
                <div class="example">
                    https://www.school.edu/classes/science
                </div>
                <p>Just like your home address has a street name and number, a URL has different parts that tell your browser exactly where to find the website.</p>
